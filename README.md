## Description
Concurrent HTTP Server is a high-performance, multi-process, multi-threaded HTTP/1.1 web server developed for the Operating Systems course. This project demonstrates advanced systems programming concepts by implementing a production-grade web server capable of handling thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

The server follows a master-worker architecture with shared memory inter-process communication and comprehensive synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety and optimal resource utilization under heavy load.
